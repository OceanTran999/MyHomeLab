# Introduction
This lab is about the CVE-2014-6271, the attacker allows to use Remote Code Execution(RCE) through the Common Gateway Interface(CGI) when sending a HTTP request to the Web Server, this attack's technique is also called ShellShock.

# What is CGI?
- CGI is a standard that helps web servers communicate with external programs or databases, it allows servers to process HTTP requests and/or sends responses back to users.
- It is written in C, Perl and also Bash script.

# Exploitation
- If target server is using CGI program written in `Bash`, when sending the requests, the server (such as Apache) will call the CGI to send the data of the request. It will pass the data in HTTP header to the CGI program by using environment variable . For example, the HTTP header has the `User-Agent` field, so we will have `HTTP_USER_AGENT` environment variable and send to CGI to handle it.
- Therefore, to exploit this, our payload just need to have `() { COMMAND;};`, which is the syntax to create an **empty function** in Bash. After that command, we can execute abitrary commands in the server.
